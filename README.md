# CarbonRom-install
Updating CarbonRom on my Motorolla Moto G5 Plus from CR 6.1 (Android 8.1) to CR 7.0 (Android 9). Phone is acting funny, so this will be a complete wipe and clean install.


**Step 1: Take down access point information**  

This is important since your new install may be missing some crucial information that your phone needs to access the network you pay for. In my current CR installation, I go to "Settings" then "Network & Internet" then "Mobile Network". Expand "Advanced" and select "Access Point Names." Select the APN that is currently in use and copy down each setting. You may need this if your network needs to be added to your fresh install.  

**Step 2: Download necessary files**  

I am redoing the recovery and everything. I unlocked my bootloader a long time ago. Easy to do, google it and void your warranty as I did mine. Good decision!  

  1) CarbonRom (device-specific, make sure you get the right one!) I am getting a Release file from Oct 30, 2019 for my Moto G5 Plus (potter). Link(https://get.carbonrom.org/device-potter.html)
